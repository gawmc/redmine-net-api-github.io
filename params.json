To enable the API-style authentication, you have to check Enable REST API in Administration -> Settings -> Authentication. Then, authentication can be done in 2 different ways:\r\nusing your regular login/password via HTTP Basic authentication.\r\nusing your API key which is a handy way to avoid putting a password in a script. The API key may be attached to each request in one of the following way:\r\n  * passed in as a \"key\" parameter\r\n  * passed in as a username with a random password via HTTP Basic authentication\r\n  * passed in as a \"X-Redmine-API-Key\" HTTP header (added in Redmine 1.1.0)\r\nYou can find your API key on your account page ( /my/account ) when logged in, on the right-hand pane of the default layout.\r\n\r\n**User Impersonation**\r\n\r\nAs of Redmine 2.2.0, you can impersonate user through the REST API by setting the X-Redmine-Switch-User header of your API request. It must be set to a user login (eg. X-Redmine-Switch-User: jsmith). This only works when using the API with an administrator account, this header will be ignored when using the API with a regular user account.\r\n\r\nIf the login specified with the X-Redmine-Switch-User header does not exist or is not active, you will receive a 412 error response.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n## Help me help you ##\r\nYour feedback is crucial. If you find anything that could improve the API, let me know. I will gladly receive your input and make the proper adjustments.\r\n\r\n**If you find this API useful let others know about it and/or rate it.**<br />\r\nYour contribution is always welcome.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n## Licence ##\r\nThe API is released under Apache 2 open-source license. You can use it for both personal and commercial purposes, build upon it and modify it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
